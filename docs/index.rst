mbb
==========

**mbb** is a basic implementation of a modified blackbody (MBB) model, commonly used for fitting the spectral energy distributions of dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs) as well as a wide array of other astrophysical phenomena.

Feel free to suggest updates/point out issues on the `GitHub page <https://github.com/mckay-sjm/mbb>`_. These docs are a work in progress.
